Annotation Graph Library
========================
  
http://agtk.sf.net/
  
This library package contains a C++ implementation of the Annotation
Graph API, a database interface, and file I/O plugins for several
existing annotation formats.  Wrappers are included which permit the
libraries to be accessed from Tcl/tk, Python and Java.
  
The AG library implements the annotation graph model [1].
