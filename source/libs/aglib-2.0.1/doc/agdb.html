<h3>Using Database Module (agdb)</h3>

<hr>

<p>To use agdb, you must first install the iODBC driver manager before
configuring and installing AGLIB. See <a
href="components.html">Components of AGLIB and required third-party
packages</a> for more information on agdb and see <a
href="install.html">Installation</a> for installation information. You
also need to install a database server (such as MySQL) and its ODBC
driver (such as MyODBC).</p>

<p>The system was tested under the following configuration:</p>

<blockquote>
MySQL-3.23.33 or above<br>
MyODBC-2.50.36 or above<br>
libiodbc-2.50.3 or above<br>
(Note: if you are installing iODBC RPMs, you need both iODBC Driver Manager
Runtime Package and iODBC RPM Developers Kit)
</blockquote>

<p>Recommended installation procedure:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install latest MySQL (avaliable at <a
href="http://www.mysql.com">http://www.mysql.com</a>)</li>
<li>Install latest MyODBC (avaliable at <a
href="http://www.mysql.com">http://www.mysql.com</a>)</li>
<li>Install latest iODBC (avaliable at <a
href="http://www.iodbc.org">http://www.iodbc.org</a>)</li>
<li>Configure your MySQL:
<ol type="a">
<li>create database (which will contain tables for AGLIB)</li>
<li>create user account to access the database server (if you don't
have one)</li>
<li>grant user read and write access to the database created.</li>
</ol>
<li>Use <tt>&lt;Your iODBC DIR&gt;/samples/odbctest</tt> to test if
you have everything setup correctly. See below for an explaination of
connect string.</li>
<li>Run configure and make of your AGLIB, with agdb enabled.</li>
<li>Run <tt>&lt;AGLIB DIR&gt;/scripts/CreateAGTables</tt> to create AG
tables.</li>
<li>Run <tt>&lt;AGLIB DIR&gt;/demo/agdb_demo</tt> to see if everything
works correctly. It's working well if you don't see any error
message.</li>
</ol>

<p>ODBC uses connection strings to connect to database servers. A
connection string contains information such as hostname, database
name, user name, password etc.</p>

<p>The following table shows some of the parameters used in a connect
string, for a complete list, see
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/doc/M/y/MyODBC_connect_parameters.html">http://www.mysql.com/doc/M/y/MyODBC_connect_parameters.html</a>.
</p>

<table border="1px">
<tr>
<th>ODBC connect string arguments</th>
<th>What the argument specifies</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>DSN</td>
<td>Registered ODBC Data Source Name.</td>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>SERVER</td>
<td>The hostname of the database server.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>UID</td>
<td>User name as established on the server. In SQL Server this is the
logon name.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>PWD</td>
<td>Password that corresponds with the logon name.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>DATABASE</td>
<td>Database to connect to. If not given, DSN is used.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>DSN is the registered ODBC Data Source Name, it should be defined
in your ~/.odbc.ini file. All other arguments can be either defined in
.odbc.ini file, or defined in the connect string itself.</p>

<p>To gain access to most ODBC data sources, you must provide a valid
User ID and corresponding password. These values are initially
registered by the database administrator.</p>

<p>Probably the easiest way is to define every argument in file
.odbc.ini under your home directory. The following is a sample entry
for DSN 'talkbank' in the configuration file for iODBC. To simplify
the explanation line numbers have been included. Please note that UID
and PWD become USER and PASSWORD, respectively, in iODBC's
configuration file.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
1  [talkbank]
2  Driver   = /pkg/ldc/lib/libmyodbc.so
3  DSN      = talkbank
4  SERVER   = talkbank.ldc.upenn.edu
5  USER     = myuserid
6  PASSWORD = mypasswd
7  DATABASE = talkbank
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Line 1 is the name of the driver section, which is 'talkbank'. You
can have multiple driver sections in one configuration file. Line 2
specifies the odbc driver to use. Line 3 gives the name of the DSN,
which is 'talkbank'. Line 4 specifies the hostname of the machine on
which the database server is running. Line 5 is the user name to use
to connect to the server. Line 6 is the password associated with the
user name. Line 7 is the database to connect to.</p>

<p>If you have all required arguments specified in your .odbc.ini file
like the one above, the connect string can simply be:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
DSN=talkbank;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you have not specified some of the arguments, say USER and
PASSWORD, in the configuration file, you can still specify them in
your connect string:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
DSN=talkbank;UID=myuserid;PWD=mypasswd;
</pre></blockquote>
