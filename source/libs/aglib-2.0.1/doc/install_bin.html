<h4>Windows zip package</h4>

<p> A set of AGLIB components compiled on an Intel Windows platform are
distributed as a zip package.  This package includes all components of
AGLIB described in the <a href="components.html#components">Components
of AGLIB and required third-party packages</a>.  However, a Python
interpreter, a Tcl/Tk interpreter and a Java Virtual Machine are not
included in the package, and they need to be installed separately if
any of these languages are to be used.  </p>

<p> When unpacked, the zip file installs the following files:
<tt>libag.dll</tt>, <tt>ag\agfio_plugin_*.dll</tt>, <tt>ag\java\*</tt>,
<tt>ag\python\*</tt>, and <tt>ag\tcl\*</tt>.
</p>

<p> The <tt>libag.dll</tt> is the main .dll file that can be used from C
and C++.  The <tt>ag\agfio_plugin_*.dll</tt> files are the optional plugin
.dll files for the file I/O architecture of AGLIB.
</p>

<p> We advise against installing the .dll files in a system directory.
Instead, we recommend setting a path to include the .dll files from a
start-up batch file for each application.
</p>

<p> Please note that there are two <tt>ag.dll</tt> files in the pacakge.
One is for Tcl and one is for Python, and they are incompatible with each
other.  
</p>

<p>
If the zip file is unpacked in the <tt>C:\aglib2.0</tt> directory, the
following DOS commands will set the environment variables to use the
libraries of the package.
