README - CMake build system
Bertin Technologies
---------------------------

GNU Autotools is the original build system for AGLIB.

In order to have a coherent build system on the whole source tree, we added CMake integration,
which also provides native cross-platform support (Linux, MacOSx, Windows,...).

Notice that we only needed the AG format, so the CMakeList of the formats directory only builds the AG format.
