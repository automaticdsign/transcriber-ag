Transcriber AG (non-official)
===========================

This repository is _not_ the official Transcriber AG repository, which is
[here](http://transag.sourceforge.net/), but an unofficial repository for
people needing to build it from sources, with a few improvements.

##Changelog##

 * adding Tibetan as possible input language
 * minor improvements to make compilation possible
 * 2.0.0 version plus Debian patches
